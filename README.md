## Merkle Multiproof Generator in Solidity

This library can generate merkle multiproofs which are identical to Open Zeppelin's Merkle tree multiproof JS library, and can also be proven using Open Zeppelin's solidity prover implementation found here.

Proof generation and root generation contains fuzz tests against the Open Zeppelin prover library. There are also unit tests and differential tests to demonstrate the parity with Open Zeppelin's JS library. 

### Building Locally
This repo is built using [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry).
1. clone the repo
2. `forge install`
3. `make differential-test`, `make fuzz-test`, `make unit-test`

To get differential tests set up:
1. `cd differential_test/js`
2. `npm install`

### Testing

The code contains three types of tests.
1. fuzz tests to ensure that any proofs generated by the library are validated by Open Zeppelin's multiproof library\
2. differential tests to ensure that the proofs generated maintain parity with the proofs generated by Open Zeppelin's merkle tree library
3. unit tests demonstrating simple tests cases
